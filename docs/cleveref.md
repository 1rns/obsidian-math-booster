When you insert a internal link to [theorem callouts](math-callouts) or equation blocks, 
the link will be displayed with the corresponding theorem's title or the [equation's number](equation-number).

(The [MathLinks](https://github.com/zhaoshenzhai/obsidian-mathlinks) API is working behind the scene!)

Note that Math Booster provides [live suggestions](suggest) that lets you easily insert links to theorems or equations.

Example:

You can configure the format of link texts in **Theorem callouts > Referencing > Format** in the plugins's settings.
