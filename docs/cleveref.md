When you [insert a internal link](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link%20to%20a%20block%20in%20a%20note) to [math callouts](math-callouts) or equation blocks, 
the link will be displayed with the corresponding theorem's title or the equation's number.

(The [MathLinks](https://github.com/zhaoshenzhai/obsidian-mathlinks) API is working behind the scene!)

See [Obsidian help](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+block+in+a+note) for how to insert a link to callouts or equations.

Example:

You can configure the format of link texts in **Math callouts > Referencing > Format** in the plugins's settings.
