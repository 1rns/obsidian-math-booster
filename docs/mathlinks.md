title: MathLinks integration

If you are a [MathLinks](https://github.com/zhaoshenzhai/obsidian-mathlinks) user, working with Math Booster might involve a redundant procedure of writing the same text in the YAML frontmatter (`mathLink` field) and the title field of a theorem callout. But you will no longer have to do that!

Suppose you have the following: The note on the right has a link to the note on the left.

![MathLinks before](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-math-booster/assets/72342591/4e70e0c2-1f6e-4e61-b343-754ebc2dc01a)

Now, click the "Edit theorem callout settings" button of the theorem callout on the top, and turn on the "Use this theorem callout to set this note's mathLink".

Tada!
