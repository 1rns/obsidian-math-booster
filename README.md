# Obsidian Math Booster

This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), which enhances your mathematical note-taking experience by introducing $\LaTeX$-like features into Obsidian.

Obsidian is excellent, but when it comes to mathematical notes, it lacks some of the essential features that $\LaTeX$ has.
And this is where Obsidian Math Booster comes in!

The core features of this plugin include:

- [Special Callouts for Theorems/Definitions/Exercises/...](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster/math-callouts.html)
- [Automatic Equation Numbering](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster/equation-number.html)
- [Clever Reference to Theorems & Equations](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster/cleveref)
- [Math Preview in Callouts & Blockquotes](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster/math-preview.html)

See the [documentation](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster/) for the details and installation instructions.
