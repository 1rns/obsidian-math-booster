# Obsidian Mathematics

This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), which enhances your mathematical note-taking experience by introducing $\LaTeX$-like features into Obsidian.

Obsidian is excellent, but when it comes to mathematical notes, it lacks some of the essential features that $\LaTeX$ has.
And this is where Obsidian Mathematics comes in!

The core features of this plugin include:

- [Special Callouts for Theorems/Definitions/Exercises/...](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/math-callouts)
- [Automatic Equation Numbering](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/equation-number)
- [Clever Reference to Theorems & Equations](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/cleveref)
- [Math Preview in Callouts & Blockquotes](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/math-preview)

See the [documentation](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math) for the details and installation instructions.
