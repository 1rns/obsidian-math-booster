# Math Booster for Obsidian

This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), which enhances your mathematical note-taking experience by introducing $\LaTeX$-like features into Obsidian.

Obsidian is excellent, but when it comes to mathematical notes, it lacks some of the essential features that $\LaTeX$ has.
And this is where **Math Booster** comes in!

The core features of this plugin include:

- [Special “math callouts” for theorems/definitions/exercises/…](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster//math-callouts)
- [Automatic equation numbering](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster//equation-number)
- [Math live preview in callouts & blockquotes](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster//math-preview)

Math callouts & equations can be [referenced with their title or number](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster//cleveref) similarly to the `cleveref` package in LaTeX.

You can also customize the appearance of math callous using CSS snippets. See the [styles gallery](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster//style-your-theorems#styles-gallery) for examples.

See the [documentation](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math-booster/) for the details and installation instructions.
