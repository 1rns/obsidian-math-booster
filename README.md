# Obsidian Mathematics

> :warning: **This plugin is in the very early stages of development.**

This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), which enhances your mathematical note taking experience by introducing $\LaTeX$-like features into Obsidian.

Obsidian is great, but when it comes to mathematical notes, it lacks some of important features that $\LaTeX$ has.
And this is where Obsidian Mathematics comes in!

plugin that enhances your mathematical note taking experience by several powerful features, including:

- [Special Callouts for Theorems/Definitions/Exercises/...](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/math-callouts)
- [Automatic Equation Numbering](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/equation-number)
- [Clever Reference to Theorems & Equations](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/cleveref)
- [Math Preview in Callouts & Blockquotes](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math/math-preview)

See the [documentation](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-math) for the details.
